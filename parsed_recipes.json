Use a sharp pair of poultry shears to cut next to the backbone on one side from the tail end to the neck. You will be cutting through bones, so a firm grasp and sharp shears are a must.

Tent with foil if any of the skin begins to brown too much.\n\n\n\n\n While turkey roasts, begin to prepare the gravy. Place the large saucepan with the reserved butter mixture over medium-high heat. Add reserved cut backbone pieces; cook, stirring often, until browned all over, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add just enough water to barely cover the backbone pieces (about 2 cups). Cover saucepan and simmer mixture on lowest heat while turkey finishes roasting.\n\n\n\n\n When turkey is done, carefully transfer the rack with the turkey from the baking sheet to a cutting board to rest, tenting with foil to keep it warm.

Carefully pour white wine and 1\/2 cup of the chicken stock onto the baking sheet, and gently scrape surface of baking sheet with a spoon as the liquids bubble to remove any browned bits that have baked on.

They\u2019re baked instead of fried, so cleanup is breeze.\u00a0\n\n\n  How to Make Italian Meatballs  \n You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the Italian meatball recipe above, but let's go over the basics:\n\n\n  Italian Meatball Ingredients  \n These are the ingredients you\u2019ll need to make this Italian meatball recipe:\u00a0\n\n\n\nBread crumbs: Use store-bought bread crumbs or\u00a0make your own at home.\u00a0\nMilk: Milk adds moisture, ensuring the meatballs don\u2019t dry out during the cooking process.\u00a0\nOnion: An onion lends bold flavor.\u00a0\nMeat: You\u2019ll need a pound of ground beef and a pound of ground pork.\u00a0\nEgg: An egg adds moisture and helps bind the meatballs together.\u00a0\nCheese: For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmesan cheese.\nSeasonings: The meatballs are seasoned with fresh parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, dried Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes.\u00a0\n\n\n Cook\u2019s Note\n\nSome recipes use equal portions of beef, veal, and pork, which is also nice, yet more expensive. These days you can find all sorts of lean-to-fat ratios for ground beef. Most stores sell 90% lean, 10% fat, but I prefer the 80% lean, 20% fat ratio for this recipe.\nYou can substitute water or beef broth for the milk if preferred.\nServe with homemade tomato sauce and polenta.\n\n\n\n\n\n  How Do You Make Italian Meatballs?  \n Here\u2019s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade Italian meatballs:\u00a0\n\n\n Cook the onion.\u00a0Mix all the ingredients together. Cove and chill.\u00a0Form the mixture into balls.\u00a0Bake the meatballs in the preheated oven.\n\n\n  What to Serve With Italian Meatballs  \n Chef John suggests serving the Italian meatballs with\u00a0homemade tomato sauce\u00a0and\u00a0polenta. They also work well as an appetizer, in a sandwich, or served over mashed potatoes, rice, or egg noodles.\n\n\n  How to Store Italian Meatballs  \n Store your leftover Italian meatballs in a shallow, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days.\n\n\n  Can You Freeze Italian Meatballs?  \n Yes, Italian meatballs freeze well. Flash freeze the cooked meatballs on a baking sheet for a few hours or up to overnight, then transfer the frozen meatballs to a freezer-safe container. Freeze for up to three months.\n\n\n If you prefer, you can also freeze the meatballs before cooking. You can easily cook them from-frozen on the stove whenever you want to whip up a quick dish.\n\n\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \n \u201cThe meatballs are wonderful,\u201d raves\u00a0Andrea Wojack. \u201cWe are kicking ourselves that we didn\u2019t make a double batch!

Mixture will stay between 212 degrees F (100 degrees C) and 216 degrees F (102 degrees C) for the majority of this time and will rise to 220 degrees F (104 degrees C) when enough liquid has evaporated.\n\n\n\n\n To test if marmalade consistency is correct, remove plate from freezer and spoon a small amount of marmalade onto plate. Return plate to freezer for 1 minute. Remove plate from freezer; pull a finger through marmalade and across plate. It should leave a clean trail. If marmalade is runny and does not leave a clean trail, return mixture in pot to a boil over medium-high, and return plate to freezer. Boil marmalade, stirring often, for 3 minutes. Remove from heat, and retest thickness using plate again; repeat if necessary until it reaches desired thickness.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n Dotdash Meredith Food Studios\n\n\n\n\n Carefully pour marmalade evenly into the prepared canning jars. Let cool to room temperature, uncovered, about 3 hours. Seal jars. Chill until marmalade sets, at least 2 hours. Store in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n Dotdash Meredith Food Studios\n\n\n\n\n  Cook's Notes:  \n If you are planning on storing the marmalade for a long time, you need to properly can it. Using tongs, lower empty jars (without lids and bands) into simmering water. Lay jars on their sides in pot so that they fill with water. Using jar lifter, turn jars right side up. Return to a gentle boil over high, reducing heat if needed to maintain a gentle boil, and boil for 10 minutes. Using a jar lifter, remove jars from pot, letting water drain back into pot. Place jars on a clean kitchen towel. Remove pot from heat; cover to keep water hot for final step of canning.\n\n\n Arrange jar bands and lids in a large, deep skillet. Add enough water to cover by 1\/2 inch. Bring water to a simmer over medium-high. Remove from heat. (Overheating will weaken rubber and the lids' ability to seal properly.)\n\n\n Spoon hot marmalade into hot, sterilized jars, using a canning funnel to keep jar rims clean and leaving 1\/4-inch headspace. Wearing gloves, wipe jar rims with a damp paper towel. Using a magnetic lid lifter, lift lids out of hot water, and place on jars. Screw on jar bands until finger-tight. (Do not overtighten as the air in the jars needs to escape. If jar bands are too tight, the seal will fail or jars will crack.)\n\n\n Using jar lifter, lower jars into hot water in pot, making sure they're standing upright on canning rack and not touching one another or sides of the pot. Make sure jars are covered by 1 to 2 inches of water (add hot water if needed).\n\n\n Bring to a vigorous boil over high. Cover and boil 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and let stand 10 minutes. Using a jar lifter, remove jars from pot, and place on a clean kitchen towel 1 inch apart. Let cool to room temperature, about 3 hours.\n\n\n As jars come to room temperature, lids should curve inward as a sign of a safely preserved jar. Wipe jars clean, and label with name and date. If any jars fail to seal properly, store in refrigerator up to 2 weeks. Sealed jars may be stored in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year.",

Transfer to prepared cooling rack to cool slightly. Repeat with remaining doughnuts. For doughnut holes, working in batches, fry, constantly moving with a slotted spoon, until evenly golden, about 1 minute. Transfer to prepared rack to cool slightly.\n\n\n\n\n Whisk together powdered sugar, melted butter, vanilla extract and salt in a bowl to make the vanilla glaze.
