       "  'directions': 'Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) with an oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Locate a rack that fits inside a large rimmed baking sheet, and set aside.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Stir together softened butter, mustard, thyme, lemon juice and zest, rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl until mixture is well blended. Set aside. Spread chopped onion, carrots, and celery in an even layer on the baking sheet, and top the baking sheet with the rack. Set aside while you prepare the turkey.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n To spatchcock (or butterfly) the turkey, create a workspace by placing a clean kitchen towel underneath a large cutting board. Place thawed and well-drained turkey on the work surface, and pat as dry as you can with a few paper towels. Arrange bird so backbone is facing up. Use a sharp pair of poultry shears to cut next to the backbone on one side from the tail end to the neck. You will be cutting through bones, so a firm grasp and sharp shears are a must. Use a paper towel or clean kitchen towel to ensure you have a good grasp of the bird if you are having any trouble.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Grasp the bird with a paper towel on the cut side of the backbone and make another cut with poultry shears along the other side to free the backbone, removing it from the bird. Use your shears to cut the backbone into 3 to 4 pieces crosswise, and place on a plate to use later to make the gravy. Pick the bird up (you will now have a U-shaped turkey), flip it, and place turkey on the work surface with the breast facing up. Use the palms of your hands with fingers interlaced, and press quickly and firmly down on the breast bone of the bird to flatten it. You should hear a slight crack, as the breastbone breaks and bird flattens.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Place turkey breast side up on the prepared rack above the layer of vegetables on the baking sheet. Pat the outside of the turkey dry with paper towels, and tuck wing tips underneath the bird. Gently slide your hands underneath the skin of the turkey along the breasts, being careful to keep skin intact. With your hands, evenly place half of the herb butter mixture (about 2/3 cup) underneath the loosened skin, pressing butter into an even layer by gently smoothing the top of the skin with your other hand to evenly distribute butter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Wash your hands, then melt the other half of the herb butter mixture in the microwave on high power for 20 seconds. Using a basting brush, brush some of the melted butter over the surface of prepared turkey, and sprinkle evenly with remaining salt and pepper. Add 1 tablespoon of the remaining herb butter mixture to a large saucepan (for the gravy), and reserve remaining butter for basting while roasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Roast turkey in the preheated oven until the thickest part of the thigh meat registers 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) on a meat thermometer, about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Turn baking sheet halfway through to ensure even browning and baste with the melted herb butter every 30 minutes. Tent with foil if any of the skin begins to brown too much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n While turkey roasts, begin to prepare the gravy. Place the large saucepan with the reserved butter mixture over medium-high heat. Add reserved cut backbone pieces; cook, stirring often, until browned all over, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add just enough water to barely cover the backbone pieces (about 2 cups). Cover saucepan and simmer mixture on lowest heat while turkey finishes roasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n When turkey is done, carefully transfer the rack with the turkey from the baking sheet to a cutting board to rest, tenting with foil to keep it warm. Spoon vegetables and all drippings from the baking sheet into the saucepan with backbone pieces. Place the baking sheet over two burners of the stove, over medium heat. Carefully pour white wine and 1/2 cup of the chicken stock onto the baking sheet, and gently scrape surface of baking sheet with a spoon as the liquids bubble to remove any browned bits that have baked on. Carefully pour contents of baking sheet into the saucepan with the roasted vegetables and drippings. Add 2 additional cups of chicken stock to the saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors meld, about 15 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Set a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl or measuring cup. Drain gravy through strainer to separate solids from the broth; press on the solids to release as much of the liquid as you can from them. Discard solids. Allow strained liquid to stand for 5 minutes and then skim the fat from the top of the surface. Keep 3 tablespoons of the fat and discard the rest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Lightly wipe the same large saucepan clean with a paper towel, then add reserved fat to saucepan over medium-high. Add shallots to saucepan, and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add flour to saucepan, and stir constantly until well-combined with fat, about 1 minute. Add strained liquid and enough chicken stock to measure a total of 6 cups liquid (about 2 additional cups of stock) to saucepan over medium-high. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly while boiling, for 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium, and allow mixture to simmer and reduce by half, 25 to 30 minutes. Season gravy with any additional salt and pepper as needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Remove turkey from rack, and place on a work surface to slice as you wish; serve with hot gravy.',\n",

They’re baked instead of fried, so cleanup is breeze.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  How to Make Italian Meatballs  \\n You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the Italian meatball recipe above, but let's go over the basics:\\n\\n\\n  Italian Meatball Ingredients  \\n These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this Italian meatball recipe:\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nBread crumbs: Use store-bought bread crumbs or\\xa0make your own at home.\\xa0\\nMilk: Milk adds moisture, ensuring the meatballs don’t dry out during the cooking process.\\xa0\\nOnion: An onion lends bold flavor.\\xa0\\nMeat: You’ll need a pound of ground beef and a pound of ground pork.\\xa0\\nEgg: An egg adds moisture and helps bind the meatballs together.\\xa0\\nCheese: For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmesan cheese.\\nSeasonings: The meatballs are seasoned with fresh parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, dried Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n Cook’s Note\\n\\nSome recipes use equal portions of beef, veal, and pork, which is also nice, yet more expensive. These days you can find all sorts of lean-to-fat ratios for ground beef. Most stores sell 90% lean, 10% fat, but I prefer the 80% lean, 20% fat ratio for this recipe.\\nYou can substitute water or beef broth for the milk if preferred.\\nServe with homemade tomato sauce and polenta.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  How Do You Make Italian Meatballs?  \\n Here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade Italian meatballs:\\xa0\\n\\n\\n Cook the onion.\\xa0Mix all the ingredients together. Cove and chill.\\xa0Form the mixture into balls.\\xa0Bake the meatballs in the preheated oven.\\n\\n\\n  What to Serve With Italian Meatballs  \\n Chef John suggests serving the Italian meatballs with\\xa0homemade tomato sauce\\xa0and\\xa0polenta. They also work well as an appetizer, in a sandwich, or served over mashed potatoes, rice, or egg noodles.\\n\\n\\n  How to Store Italian Meatballs  \\n Store your leftover Italian meatballs in a shallow, airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days.\\n\\n\\n  Can You Freeze Italian Meatballs?  \\n Yes, Italian meatballs freeze well. Flash freeze the cooked meatballs on a baking sheet for a few hours or up to overnight, then transfer the frozen meatballs to a freezer-safe container. Freeze for up to three months.\\n\\n\\n If you prefer, you can also freeze the meatballs before cooking. You can easily cook them from-frozen on the stove whenever you want to whip up a quick dish.\\n\\n\\n  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise  \\n “The meatballs are wonderful,” raves\\xa0Andrea Wojack. “We are kicking ourselves that we didn’t make a double batch! But how could we know they’d be so full of flavor, so juicy, so tender?”\\n\\n\\n “This is my go-to meatball recipe,” says one Allrecipes community member. “The meatballs come out perfectly each and every time that I make them. They bake perfectly and I believe that refrigerating the mixed ingredients is the key. The texture is perfect and the flavor is delicious.”\\n\\n\\n “These meatballs are the best I ever made,” according to\\xa0Kay. “My husband loved them.

       "  'directions': \"Place flour in a large bowl and create a well in the center. Add eggs and 1/4 teaspoon salt to well; beat using a fork to break up egg mixture. Slowly begin to incorporate flour into egg mixture, stirring from the center and gradually working outwards until shaggy pieces of dough begin to form. Use your hands to bring shaggy dough pieces together to form a shaggy ball. Transfer shaggy ball and any remaining flour in bowl to a clean work surface. Knead, pressing any loose flour into dough, until dough is smooth and elastic, 10 to 12 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap; let rest at room temperature at least 1 hour or up to 2 hours, or in a refrigerator up to 1 day. (If refrigerating, let come to room temperature before rolling.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Place mascarpone in a small bowl; set aside. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and shallot; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir shallot mixture into mascarpone in bowl along with herbs, lemon zest and juice, pepper, and remaining salt until combined. Gently stir in lobster. Chill, covered, for 15 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n While lobster filling chills, unwrap dough, and divide evenly into 2 portions. Place 1 dough portion on a clean work surface; wrap remaining dough portion in plastic wrap. Shape dough into a rectangle; press dough to flatten using heel of hand. Starting with the widest setting, pass dough through pasta machine 2 times. Fold the outer tapered ends of pasta sheet in toward the center like an envelope, so that the width of the pasta sheet is similar to the width of the pasta roller. Pass pasta sheet through widest setting 1 more time. Continue rolling pasta through machine, reducing roller width 1 notch at a time, until sheet is about 1/16-inch thick and you can see the outline of your hand through the sheet. Cut sheet in half crosswise to make them easier to work with. Cover 1 sheet loosely with plastic wrap. Lightly dust work surface with flour and place remaining dough sheet on surface.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Leaving a 1-inch edge from the short sides of the dough sheet, place 1-tablespoon mounds of lobster filling 2 inches apart along center of sheet (about 4 to 6 mounds per sheet). Lightly brush dough around lobster filling with water. Loosely lift long edge of dough sheet and fold over filling, lining up edges. Press on dough around each mound to seal and press out air pockets. Using a fluted pastry wheel or pizza cutter, trim the unfolded edge of the ravioli. Cut pasta between mounds to form individual ravioli. Place ravioli on a baking sheet lined with a clean kitchen towel. Cover with a second clean kitchen towel. Repeat process with remaining pasta sheet, dough, and filling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Cut remaining 4 tablespoons butter into 4 pieces. Bring clam juice and wine to a simmer in a large skillet over high heat. Simmer, undisturbed, until reduced to about 1/3 cup, about 7 minutes. Gradually stir in remaining 4 tablespoons butter, one piece at a time, waiting until butter is nearly melted before adding the next piece. Stir in heavy cream. Cook over high heat, stirring often, until sauce is thick enough to lightly coat back of a spoon, about 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes. Remove from heat and cover to keep warm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Working in 2 batches if needed, boil ravioli until tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Drain. Divide ravioli among 4 plates. Drizzle cream sauce evenly over ravioli. Garnish with herbs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Tips  \\n You can use wonton wrappers but you're not going to get that springy/al dente bite like you would in fresh pasta. With a soft filling and creamy sauce that sounded like too many soft textures so I went the fresh pasta route. When shaping the ravioli, take your time and do your best to get rid of any air pockets to prevent them from bursting when you cook them.\",\n",

Continue to cook and stir until vegetables are very soft and beginning to brown, about 5 to 10 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Season with ginger, cardamom, allspice, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper; stir for 1 minute. Pour in chicken stock; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer gently for 5 to 10 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Working in batches, pour soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get soup moving before leaving it on to purée. Pour blended soup into a clean pot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Stir in milk and cream. Return to a simmer over medium-low heat. Season with salt and pepper to serve.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Recipe Tip\\nYou can also use a stick blender to purée the soup right in the cooking pot.',\n",

I used \"Better Than Bouillon.\" Beef bone broth can be used instead of the beef bouillon base. You can also use fresh herbs instead of dried - use 1 teaspoon each of finely chopped fresh thyme and fresh rosemary.\\n\\n\\n Make sure to sauté the mushrooms until well-browned before adding the onions. Deep browning on the bottom of pan is encouraged, as it build flavor and give the stew its beefy color.',\n",

       "  'directions': \"Slice off and discard tops and bottoms from oranges and lemon. Peel off and discard skin and pith of 3 of the oranges. Quarter all oranges and lemon lengthwise, then thinly slice into 1/8-inch slices, discarding seeds while slicing. Place all citrus slices in a large bowl and cover with water. Cover and refrigerate for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Dotdash Meredith Food Studios\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Pour orange and lemon slices along with water into a large stainless steel saucepan or Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until orange rinds have softened and can be cut with a spoon with slight resistance, about 45 minutes, skimming any foam that rises to top during process.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Dotdash Meredith Food Studios\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Inspect 4 (1/2-pint) canning jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water until orange marmalade is ready. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm soapy water. Place a small plate in the freezer.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Dotdash Meredith Food Studios\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Add sugar to orange mixture and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has slightly reduced, bubbles are slightly larger in center, and a thermometer reads 220 degrees F (104 degrees C) about 40 to 45 minutes. Mixture will stay between 212 degrees F (100 degrees C) and 216 degrees F (102 degrees C) for the majority of this time and will rise to 220 degrees F (104 degrees C) when enough liquid has evaporated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n To test if marmalade consistency is correct, remove plate from freezer and spoon a small amount of marmalade onto plate. Return plate to freezer for 1 minute. Remove plate from freezer; pull a finger through marmalade and across plate. It should leave a clean trail. If marmalade is runny and does not leave a clean trail, return mixture in pot to a boil over medium-high, and return plate to freezer. Boil marmalade, stirring often, for 3 minutes. Remove from heat, and retest thickness using plate again; repeat if necessary until it reaches desired thickness.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Dotdash Meredith Food Studios\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Carefully pour marmalade evenly into the prepared canning jars. Let cool to room temperature, uncovered, about 3 hours. Seal jars. Chill until marmalade sets, at least 2 hours. Store in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Dotdash Meredith Food Studios\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Cook's Notes:  \\n If you are planning on storing the marmalade for a long time, you need to properly can it. Using tongs, lower empty jars (without lids and bands) into simmering water. Lay jars on their sides in pot so that they fill with water. Using jar lifter, turn jars right side up. Return to a gentle boil over high, reducing heat if needed to maintain a gentle boil, and boil for 10 minutes. Using a jar lifter, remove jars from pot, letting water drain back into pot. Place jars on a clean kitchen towel. Remove pot from heat; cover to keep water hot for final step of canning.\\n\\n\\n Arrange jar bands and lids in a large, deep skillet. Add enough water to cover by 1/2 inch. Bring water to a simmer over medium-high. Remove from heat. (Overheating will weaken rubber and the lids' ability to seal properly.)\\n\\n\\n Spoon hot marmalade into hot, sterilized jars, using a canning funnel to keep jar rims clean and leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Wearing gloves, wipe jar rims with a damp paper towel. Using a magnetic lid lifter, lift lids out of hot water, and place on jars. Screw on jar bands until finger-tight. (Do not overtighten as the air in the jars needs to escape. If jar bands are too tight, the seal will fail or jars will crack.)\\n\\n\\n Using jar lifter, lower jars into hot water in pot, making sure they're standing upright on canning rack and not touching one another or sides of the pot. Make sure jars are covered by 1 to 2 inches of water (add hot water if needed).\\n\\n\\n Bring to a vigorous boil over high. Cover and boil 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and let stand 10 minutes. Using a jar lifter, remove jars from pot, and place on a clean kitchen towel 1 inch apart. Let cool to room temperature, about 3 hours.\\n\\n\\n As jars come to room temperature, lids should curve inward as a sign of a safely preserved jar. Wipe jars clean, and label with name and date. If any jars fail to seal properly, store in refrigerator up to 2 weeks. Sealed jars may be stored in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year.\",\n",

Microwave mixture until it reaches 105 degrees F to 115 degrees F (40 degrees C to 46 degrees C), 30 to 60 seconds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Whisk together flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, melted butter, and milk mixture. Beat with an electric mixer at medium speed until a soft dough forms and begins to pull away from sides of bowl, 3 to 5 minutes. (Dough will be sticky.) Lightly grease a bowl. Transfer dough to the bowl and turn to coat. Chill, covered, until dough is easy to handle, at least 2 hours or up to overnight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Grease two 9-inch round cake pans or two 8x8-inch baking pans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Stir together brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Punch down dough; divide in half. Roll out one portion of dough on a lightly floured surface into a 6x16-inch rectangle. (If dough springs back when rolling, let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.) Spread 2 tablespoons softened butter over the dough. Sprinkle half of the cinnamon-brown sugar mixture over butter; gently pat mixture so it adheres to the dough.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Starting on a long side, roll up dough and pinch along seam to seal. Slice dough log into 16 (1-inch-thick) pieces. Put rolls, cut sides down, in one of the prepared pans. Repeat with the remaining dough, cinnamon-sugar, and softened butter. Let rise, covered, in a warm place until rolls nearly double in size, about 30 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Bake until rolls until golden brown, 17 to 22 minutes. Cool in pan on a wire rack 10 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Meanwhile for the icing, beat cream cheese, softened butter, milk, and vanilla with an electric mixer at medium speed until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually beat in powdered sugar until smooth. Drizzle rolls with icing and serve warm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Cook's Notes:  \\n If you're giving the cinnamon rolls as gifts, use disposable foil pans.\\n\\n\\n For a festive wreath shape, arrange rolls in a well-greased fluted tube pan or around a small oven-safe custard cup on a parchment-lined 14- to 16-inch pizza pan. Let rise and bake as directed.\\n\\n\\n For speedier rolls, substitute two thawed 1-pound packages frozen bread dough for the homemade dough and skip ahead to Step 3.\\n\\n\\n  Variations:  \\n Caramel Apple Rolls: Spread 1/3 cup caramel sauce onto each rolled-out dough portion. Top each with half the cinnamon-brown sugar mixture (omitting butter) and 1/2 cup peeled, diced apple. Roll, let rise, bake, and cool as directed. Instead of icing, drizzle with more caramel sauce once cooled.\\n\\n\\n PB&J Rolls: Spread 1/3 cup warmed peanut butter and 1/3 cup desired flavor jam onto each rolled-out dough portion. (Omit cinnamon-brown sugar mixture and butter.) Roll, let rise, bake, and cool as directed. If desired, for peanut butter icing, stir together 3/4 cup powdered sugar, 2 Tbsp. each warmed peanut butter and milk, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl until smooth.\\n\\n\\n Blueberry-Cinnamon Rolls: Spread 1/3 cup blueberry jam onto each rolled-out dough portion. Sprinkle each with 1/3 cup dried blueberries and half of the cinnamon-brown sugar mixture. Roll, let rise, bake, and cool as directed. If desired, for maple icing, stir together 3/4 cup powdered sugar, 2 Tbsp. each maple syrup and milk, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl until smooth.\",\n",

Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until a very thick paste forms, about 3 minutes (watch constantly—it thickens quickly). Cool briefly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Heat 1 cup milk in a second saucepan to 105 degrees F to 115 degrees F (40 degrees C to 46 degrees C). Transfer warm milk to the bowl of a stand mixer; stir in yeast and let stand for 5 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Add evaporated milk, melted butter, eggs, sugar, salt, vanilla, the cooled tangzhong, and 2 cups cake flour to the stand mixer. Using the paddle attachment, beat at low speed until mixture is smooth, about 3 minutes. Gradually beat in remaining 2 1/4 cups cake flour to make a soft dough. Continue beating at low speed until dough is smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Dough will be soft.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes, adding 2 to 4 tablespoons additional cake flour. Be careful not to add too much flour. (If dough begins to stick to surface, use a bench scraper to lift dough from surface and add a dusting of flour. If your dough is too soft to knead, chill covered for 2 hours or up to overnight before kneading.) Shape dough into a ball. Transfer to a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease surface; cover. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Punch down dough and turn out onto floured surface. Roll dough into a 10x15-inch rectangle about 1/2-inch thick. If dough springs back, let it rest an additional 10 minutes. Lightly flour 2 large baking sheets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Cut dough using 3-inch and 1-inch round cutters to create doughnuts and doughnut holes. Arrange cutouts 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Cover with a towel and let cutouts rise in a warm place until very light and fluffy, about 1 hour. [If you have scraps, gently knead together, being careful not to overwork dough; let rest 10 minutes before cutting.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Arrange wire racks in two 10x15-inch rimmed baking pans (one for cooling, one for finished glazed doughnuts).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n About 20 minutes before doughnuts are done rising, pour oil to a depth of 2 1/2 to 3 inches into a large skillet or a deep-fat fryer. Heat to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Working in batches of 2 to 3 doughnuts, fry, turning once halfway through, until golden, about 90 seconds. Transfer to prepared cooling rack to cool slightly. Repeat with remaining doughnuts. For doughnut holes, working in batches, fry, constantly moving with a slotted spoon, until evenly golden, about 1 minute. Transfer to prepared rack to cool slightly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Whisk together powdered sugar, melted butter, vanilla extract and salt in a bowl to make the vanilla glaze. Whisk in hot water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency. If glaze thickens, stir in additional hot water, 1 teaspoon at a time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Dip warm doughnuts and doughnut holes into vanilla glaze, turning to coat both sides. Arrange doughnuts on the second prepared rack to allow glaze to set, about 30 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Cook's Notes:  \\n Instead of evaporated milk you can use 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk as well.\\n\\n\\n Store doughnuts at room temperature in a loosely covered container up to 24 hours. Freeze unglazed doughnuts in an airtight container up to 1 month. Heat frozen doughnuts in a 350 degrees F (175 degrees c) oven for about 10 minutes. Glaze as directed while still warm.\",\n",

Add flour, eggs, sugar, and salt. Use the dough hook to knead the mixture until the flour almost disappears, about 1 minute. Add the soft room temperature butter, and continue kneading the dough until a very smooth ball of dough forms, 4 to 5 minutes.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n ALLRECIPES / BAHAREH NIATI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Set dough into a lightly buttered bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, 2 to 3 hours.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n ALLRECIPES / BAHAREH NIATI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Punch down the dough and divide in 2 pieces. Form each half into a smooth ball and transfer each one into a plastic bag. Refrigerate bags overnight for best results or the dough can be used immediately. Each half of the dough will make 4 brioche.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n ALLRECIPES / BAHAREH NIATI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n When ready to make, roll and stretch dough into a 14 x 10 inch rectangle. Spread 4 tablespoons of soft room temperature butter over two thirds of the dough, stopping 1/2 inch from the edge.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n ALLRECIPES / BAHAREH NIATI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Fold unbuttered third up over the top, and then the opposite end to complete the trifold.

Braid together, and seal at bottom. Flip over and add about 1 tablespoon of dark chocolate chunks along the center of the braided dough, or more to taste. Roll up from the smaller end to create a knot. Place seam side down in buttered muffin tin.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n ALLRECIPES / BAHAREH NIATI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n After all braids are done, cover, and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
